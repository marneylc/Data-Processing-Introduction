Signal processing with xcms

There is a full tutorial from the makers of XCMS here: http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/xcms/inst/doc/xcmsPreprocess.pdf .  XCMS is an R package that enables the visualization and basic processing of chromatographic and mass spectrometry data files. It requires that the data be converted to an open format such as mzXML prior to attempting to load in the data.

Proteowizard needs to be installed and can be found here: http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/downloads.shtml

First we are going to look at direct infusion orbitrap mass spectrometry data. If you have a couple .RAW Xcalibur files you can use those. Use proteowizard to convert them to mzXML without any additional peak picking or processing available with proteowizard. There are a couple of mzXML files available for download from my google drive account here: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B06AQDbcyIg8Q2ZFYm1RNmhnMUE&usp=sharing

Okay, open up R or preferably RStudio. Now where did you put the mzXML files? Let's store that information in a variable. A variable in a computer language is very similar to its definition in algebra. It holds a value.

I put my files in a temp folder in my Downloads directory. If yours is different be sure to put the correct path in.

``` R
path = "C:/Users/marneyl/Downloads/temp/"
```

Now take a look at the contents of the folder from within R.

``` R
list.files(path)
```

list.files() is our first encounter with a function. It is a built in function that comes with the installation of R. Functions take argument, in our case the variable path, and return values. There is some internal process that turns the path that you give the function list.files() into a list of file names in that folder.

Another extremely useful function in R is the help() function, which pulls up the help file for any other function or object. Try it,

``` R
help(list.files)
```

or

``` R
?list.files
```
